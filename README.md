# Introduction to AM1

## What is AM1?

AM1 is a scenario-based assessment designed to evaluate a learner's ability to apply core data skills in a realistic workplace context. It forms part of the wider assessment strategy for data-related apprenticeship programmes, such as the Level 3 Data Technician or Level 4 Data Analyst standards.

This task is not just about theoretical knowledge — it tests how well you can:

- Work with messy or incomplete data
- Clean, validate, and combine multiple datasets
- Apply logical thinking to solve data problems
- Use appropriate tools (e.g. Excel, Power BI, or Python) to manipulate and present data
- Communicate findings clearly using visuals and written summaries

## Purpose of AM1

The purpose of AM1 is to simulate a typical task you might face in a real-world data role. You are given raw data files, often from different sources, and asked to:

1. **Import and clean the data**
2. **Resolve errors and inconsistencies**
3. **Merge datasets appropriately**
4. **Create calculated fields and perform analysis**
5. **Summarise your findings using charts and comments**

This helps assess both your technical ability and your understanding of how data can be used to support decision-making in a business context.

## What to Expect

- A workplace scenario (e.g. working for a finance team, a hospital, or a tech company)
- Two or more datasets to work with
- A series of structured tasks or questions
- A requirement to produce a clear and well-organised output file with:
  - Cleaned data
  - Visualisations
  - Summary statistics
  - Brief written insights

Completing AM1 successfully demonstrates that you are ready to handle day-to-day data tasks and communicate insights effectively — key skills for any data professional.
